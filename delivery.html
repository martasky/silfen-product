       <p>Delivery inside of Denmark takes 1-3 business days. 
        Delivery outside of Denmark takes 3-9 business days.
        The shipping time is the estimated time from when the package leaves our warehouse in Denmark until it reaches its destination. 
        On all orders we offer a fair shipping fee depending on shipping distance.</p>

        <div class="delivery-title">
            <h2 class="highlight-green-return">Return</h2>
            </div>
            <p>If for any reason you are not satisfied with the items purchased, you can return your purchase within 21 days for a full refund. The return period is counted from the day you receive your goods.</p>
    
<p>When returning goods please ensure that you fill in and enclose the return form. The return form will be enclosed in your delivery. If you have not received one, please contact us. You will find the address for returns on the return form.
    <br>All items must be returned unused. All original packaging, price labels etc shall be returned with the product, 
    without having been tampered with. All tags must still be attached to the item.
</p>

<p>Costs incurred in returning are for your own account, and please remember that you as a customer are responsible for the package until it reaches our warehouse. Once the package is received at our warehouse and approved, the purchase price will be refunded to your account.</p>

<p>Please note card refunds may take up to 10 business days for your bank to complete depending on processing time.
    This can vary greatly between card issuers, and unfortunately we are unable to influence this.</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, we are not able to customize exchange orders.
    We therefore kindly ask you to place a new order on <u>www.silfenstudio.com</u></p>
<p>
    All returns must be shipped to:<br>
    ADAX A/S<br>
    ATT. SILFEN RETURN<br>
    Vestre Hedevej 18<br>
    4000 Roskilde<br>
    Denmark</p>
<p>We recommend that your return package is shipped as parcel post.
    This way the package can be tracked, and it excludes doubt of wether the package was returned, and the package can be traced.</p>
