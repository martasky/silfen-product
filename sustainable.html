  Sustainability is a fuzzy word. At SILFEN it means putting action behind the words, considering all stakeholders and always aiming a little bit higher when creating another collection. As a young, global fashion brand, it is our duty to take care of the planet, not only for own sake, but for all future generations to come.
</p>
<p>
  Since day one, we have launched various initiatives to keep our carbon footprint to an absolute minimum as well as making conscious decisions concerning the social impact on the communities in the countries, in which we operate.
</p>
<p>As of 2020 we presented the brand under a new name,” SILFEN”. We believe that this small change further represents a new and greener future for SILFEN. We always strive to deliver high quality products in better materials. Within the next couple of collections, we will start implementing more conscious initiatives within the company, and we hope that this inspire you – our customers and consumers, as we are all in this together!
</p>
<p>As a company with great manufacturing activities, we know that we have a responsibility. Our focus is to make as green a production as possible, and we will continue to launch new initiatives to lower our carbon footprint even further.
