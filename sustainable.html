            Sustainability is a fuzzy word. At SILFEN it means putting action
            behind the words, considering all stakeholders and always aiming a
            little bit higher when creating another collection. As a young,
            global fashion brand, it is our duty to take care of the planet, not
            only for own sake, but for all future generations to come.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since day one, we have launched various initiatives to keep our
            carbon footprint to an absolute minimum as well as making conscious
            decisions concerning the social impact on the communities in the
            countries, in which we operate.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of 2020 we presented the brand under a new name,” SILFEN”. We
            believe that this small change further represents a new and greener
            future for SILFEN. We always strive to deliver high quality products
            in better materials. Within the next couple of collections, we will
            start implementing more conscious initiatives within the company,
            and we hope that this inspire you – our customers and consumers, as
            we are all in this together!
          </p>
          <p>
            As a company with great manufacturing activities, we know that we
            have a responsibility. Our focus is to make as green a production as
            possible, and we will continue to launch new initiatives to lower
            our carbon footprint even further.

            The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries
            worldwide, and one of the biggest issues is the use and
            contamination of drinking water. We try to minimize the water
            consumption in our production in an effort to decrease its negative
            impact on the environment and to ensure local access to clean water.

            All cotton used for production of SILFEN bags is either made from
            eco-friendly or organic cotton. This means that there is much less
            consumption of water throughout production and treatment of our
            cotton, than conventional cotton products.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2020 we will introduce a new collection of bags made from a new
            material; rPET or Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate. This recycled
            material is primarily made from plastic waste collected from the
            oceans, or from recycled plastic bottles gathered from all over the
            world.

            At Team Silfen, we believe that we have many, wide-spanning

            also the people who build our products from scratch. We believe that
            it is our job to amplify a healthy and socially responsible conduct
            within our organization, including all our suppliers. We ensure the
            ethical development of future generations by guaranteeing that our
            suppliers do not support or make use of child labor. We encourage
            our factories to ensure that all families have the possibility to
            put their children in school.

          <p>
            Team Silfen provides insurance to all our hard-working employees as
            well as their family. Our factories also grant pensions to all
            employees, providing them with financial stability after retirement.

            We support the different religions of employees and protect their
            right to engage with rituals, prayers etc. at any time. We condemn
            discrimination, and make sure that the employees are protected from
            prejudice and injustice at the workplace.

            We visit our manufacturers regularly to ensure that they follow the
            issued principles regarding working conditions, quality, pollution
            etc. This allows us to promise our customers that a SILFEN bag is
            always crafted in a responsible manner.
