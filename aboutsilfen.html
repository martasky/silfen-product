        SILFEN is a Danish accessory brand established in 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are proud to offer high quality products created in genuine materials. Our primary focus is on designing items that reflect the trends of each season, but timeless classics are also part of our portfolio.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future we want to continue working on colorful designs in different kind of materials. We love to play with textures in order to challenge our own perception of creating new stiles. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We are never afraid of trying new combinations and we want to offer you the best design at a reasonable price. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But this doesn't come at any price, making our products sustainable is a must. And so, we try to contribute with our designs to a better future.

  Behind SILFEN stand the siblings Daniel and Celine Silfen. 
Both have a deep passion for Danish design and growing up, their childhood was filled with beautiful bags. 
</p>
<p>
  They love to build up the brand's DNA with a new and playful aesthetic towards the accessory - the bag.
